802.11 MIB Support for NetSNMP

The 802.11 MIB support for NetSNMP 5.0.8 found here uses Wireless Extension information 
to populate the 802.11 MIB. See 
http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Jean_Tourrilhes/Linux/Tools.html for more details about 
Wireless Extensions.

Drivers vary in what funtions and data they do and do not support in terms of Wireless 
Extensions, so the 802.11 MIB is populated based on what the particular driver makes 
available. Future releases will include special case data that is available in the HostAP and 
MadWiFi drivers only.

See http://hostap.epitest.fi/ for information on the HostAP driver for the 
Prism 2/2.5/3 chipsets and http://sourceforge.net/projects/madwifi/ for more 
information on the MadWiFi driver for the Atheros chipsets.

This release assumes you already have a working build for NetSNMP in place. See 
http://www.net-snmp.org/ for details about installing NetSNMP on a Linux or other
Unix oriented OS. To add 802.11 MIB support, unzip the files in this release to 
the following directory:

.../net-snmp-5.0.8/agent/mibgroup 

Reconfigure NetSNMP by adding the following parameter to the configuration step 
(from the .../net-snmp-5.0.8 directory):

--with-mib-modules="ieee802dot11"

Your configuration command may look a bit different than mine which is:

./configure --with-cflags="-g -O0 -Dlinux" --with-mib-modules="ieee802dot11"

Now rebuild NetSNMP using the make clean, make, make install commands.

That's it, assuming you already had a NetSNMP build that was responding to SNMP
requests.

Keep in mind this is a beta release and only GETs are supported at
the moment. Please send feedback about problems and/or enhancements 
to lsimmons@avantcom.com.
